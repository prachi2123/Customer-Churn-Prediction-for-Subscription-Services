# Customer-Churn-Prediction-for-Subscription-Services
Predicted which customers are likely to cancel their subscription using historical customer data.
The "Customer Churn Prediction for Subscription Services" project aims to predict whether customers are likely to cancel (churn) their subscription to a service. Churn prediction is crucial for subscription-based businesses like streaming services, SaaS platforms, and telecom companies, as retaining customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.
